Question 1

We have been contracted to write a software subsystem for an air traffic control
system. This software manages a queue of aircraft's and prioritizes the orders of
take offs and landings based on the aircraft's type and size. Write a
constructor function, `ATCQueue`, that creates and manages the aircraft queue.

Aircraft's are represented by objects that have at least, but are not limited to,
the following properties.

| Property | Value |
| - | - |
| `type` | `passenger` or `cargo` |
| `size` | `small` or `large` |

The aircraft queue should implement the following interface.

| Method | Parameters | Return | Notes |
| - | - | - | - |
| `aircraftCount()` | None | Integer | Count the number of aircraft's in the queue. |
| `enqueue()` | Aircraft | None | Add an aircraft to the queue. |
| `dequeue()` | None | Aircraft | Remove an aircraft from the queue and return it. |

The process that manages the aircraft queue satisfies the following conditions.
-   There is no limit on the size of the aircraft queue.
-   Aircraft's are dequeued according to their priority.
-   Passenger aircraft's have higher priority than cargo aircraft's.
-   If two aircraft's have the same type but different sizes, then the large
aircraft has a higher priority.
-   If there is more than one aircraft with the same type and size, then the
        aircraft that was enqueued earlier has higher priority.
